A collection of Dockerfiles I've built.

* php is my build of PHP 7.0 PHP-FPM, designed for running WordPress.  It's trivial to add additional PHP packages necessary to support other PHP apps, like tt-rss.

* coredns is an easy-to-run DNS resolver for local networks that makes upstream queries to IBM's Quad9 and CloudFlare's 1.1.1.1, using DNS+TLS.
